A somewhat complete list of my papers can be found on my [thing
On this page I have featured select research works of mine that I think are important or interesting. Academia often pushes us towards excessive publication, so by providing a shortened list of highlights my aim is to not waste your time. In addition to the actual paper, for each featured work I will also provide some extra material such as code, video, simplified blog-style versions, or even essays about the concept genesis and research process. My hope is that the extra material will help demystify the papers and make the learning process quicker and more enjoyable.
